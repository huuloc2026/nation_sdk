To build an SDK (Software Development Kit) for interacting with the RFID reader based on the provided "RFID Reader Data Communication Protocol", you should follow a structured workflow that translates the protocol specifications into reusable functions.

Here's a step-by-step workflow, along with the key functions you'd need to implement:

### Workflow for Building an RFID Reader SDK

**Step 1: Understand Data Types and Byte Order**
Before writing any code, internalize the data types and byte order.
*   **Data Types**: U8 (unsigned char), S8 (signed char), U16 (unsigned short), S16 (signed short), U32 (unsigned long), S32 (signed long).
*   **Byte Order**: All data transmitted must be in "big-endian" format.

**Step 2: Implement Low-Level Communication (UART Abstraction)**
Your SDK will need functions to send and receive raw bytes over the UART interface. This is the foundation upon which all other protocol layers are built.
*   **Function**: `Init_UART_Connection(port_settings)`
    *   **Description**: Establishes the physical UART connection to the reader. This would involve configuring baud rate, data bits, stop bits, parity, etc., specific to your UART library.
*   **Function**: `Send_Raw_Bytes(byte_array)`
    *   **Description**: Transmits a raw array of bytes over the established UART connection.
*   **Function**: `Receive_Raw_Bytes()` or `Read_N_Bytes(n)`
    *   **Description**: Receives a raw array of bytes from the UART connection. This might be blocking or non-blocking, depending on your design. It should be capable of reading a full frame.

**Step 3: Implement CRC16 Checksum Calculation**
The protocol uses a CRC16 data checksum (CCITT-16 algorithm) for error detection. This is crucial for verifying the integrity of both outgoing commands and incoming responses.
*   **Function**: `Calculate_CRC16_CCITT(data_buffer, length)`
    *   **Description**: Implements the CRC16-CCITT calculation.
    *   **Details**:
        *   The calculation excludes the "Frame Header" (0x5A).
        *   It covers the "Protocol Control Word", "Serial device address" (if present), "Data Length", and "Data parameters" fields.
        *   The initial value for the calculation is `0`.
        *   The check polynomial is specified as X^16 + X^15 + X^2 + 1, as stated in the `CRC16_CCITT_CalculateBuf` function description in Appendix 1. (Note: Appendix 1 also mentions X^16 + X^12 + X^5 + 1 in the `CRC16_CCITT` and `CRC16_CCITT_CalateByte` function descriptions, so ensure consistency with the primary description for `CRC16_CCITT_CalculateBuf`).
    *   **Reference**: Refer directly to `CRC16_CCITT_CalculateBuf` in Appendix 1.

**Step 4: Implement Command Frame Construction**
This is the core function that builds a complete command frame as a byte array, ready for transmission.
*   **Function**: `Build_Command_Frame(protocol_type_number, protocol_version_no, message_category_number, message_id, data_parameters_list)`
    *   **Description**: Assembles the entire byte frame for a command.
    *   **Details**:
        1.  **Frame Header**: Prepend `0x5A`.
        2.  **Protocol Control Word (4 bytes)**:
            *   Set `Protocol Type Number` (Bits 31-24) to `0` for UHF RFID reader protocol.
            *   Set `Protocol Version No.` (Bits 23-16) (e.g., `0x01` for version No.1).
            *   Set `RS485 Flag Bit` (Bit 13) to `0` for UART communication.
            *   Set `Reader notification Flag Bit` (Bit 12) to `0` as this is an instruction from the upper computer.
            *   Set `Message Category Number` (Bits 11-8) (e.g., `1` for "RFID Configuration and operation messages").
            *   Set `Message ID (MID)` (Bits 7-0) for the specific instruction (e.g., `0x01` for "Configure the Reader Power").
        3.  **Serial Device Address (1 byte)**: This field is **omitted** since the RS485 Flag Bit is `0` for UART.
        4.  **Data Length (2 bytes, U16)**: Calculate the total length of the `Data parameters` field in bytes and add it. Ensure big-endian conversion.
        5.  **Data Parameters (N bytes)**: Concatenate the actual instruction parameters. Remember to handle mandatory (M) and optional (PID) parameters, and variable-length parameters with their 2-byte length fields.
        6.  **Check Code (2 bytes)**: Calculate the CRC16 checksum over the entire frame *excluding* the `Frame Header` and append it. Ensure big-endian conversion.
    *   **Output**: A complete byte array representing the command frame.

**Step 5: Implement Response Frame Parsing**
This function takes a raw byte array received from the reader and parses it into a structured object or dictionary, allowing easy access to the response components.
*   **Function**: `Parse_Response_Frame(byte_array_response)`
    *   **Description**: Deconstructs the received byte array into its logical components.
    *   **Details**:
        1.  Verify `Frame Header` is `0x5A`.
        2.  Extract `Protocol Control Word` and parse its bits.
        3.  Check if `Serial device address` is present (based on RS485 Flag in Control Word) and extract if so.
        4.  Extract `Data Length` (U16).
        5.  Extract `Data parameters` based on `Data Length`.
        6.  Extract `Check Code`.
        7.  **Crucially**, re-calculate the CRC16 checksum on the received data (excluding frame header) and compare it with the received `Check Code` for integrity. If they don't match, this indicates a "Wrong Type Mode CRC check error".
        8.  Parse specific parameters within `Data parameters` based on the `Message ID` and `Message Category Number` found in the `Protocol Control Word`.
    *   **Output**: A structured data object containing the parsed response, including a flag for CRC validation.

**Step 6: Implement Connection Initialization and State Management**
*   **Function**: `Connect_Reader_And_Initialize()`
    *   **Description**: This function should wrap the UART connection and the crucial initial "stop instructions".
    *   **Details**:
        1.  Call `Init_UART_Connection()`.
        2.  Send "stop instructions" to the reader. This ensures the reader switches to an "Idle waiting" state where it can receive and execute instructions normally.
        3.  Handle the response from the "stop instructions" to confirm the reader is workable.

**Step 7: Implement High-Level Command Wrappers**
Create user-friendly functions for each specific command supported by the protocol. These functions will abstract away the low-level frame building and parsing.
*   **General Pattern**:
    *   **Function**: `Command_Name(parameters...)`
        *   **Description**: Calls `Build_Command_Frame` with appropriate `Message Category Number`, `Message ID`, and `Data parameters` for the specific command.
        *   Sends the constructed frame using `Send_Raw_Bytes`.
        *   Waits for and receives the response using `Receive_Raw_Bytes`.
        *   Parses the response using `Parse_Response_Frame`.
        *   Checks for errors (e.g., `Error Type` from the parsed response, or CRC mismatch).
        *   Returns the parsed data or throws an error.

*   **Examples of specific command functions (from Sections 4.2 and 5.2):**
    *   `Query_Reader_Information()` (MID: 0x00, Category: 1)
    *   `Configure_Serial_Port_Parameters(baud_rate_enum)` (MID: 0x02, Category: 1)
    *   `Restart_Reader()` (MID: 0x0F, Category: 1). Note the required `Confirmation code` parameter `0x5AA5A55A`.
    *   `Query_Reader_Power()` (MID: 0x02, Category: 5)
    *   `Read_EPC_Tag(antenna_mask, read_mode, optional_parameters...)` (MID: 0x10, Category: 5)
    *   `Stop_RFID_Operations()` (MID: 0xFF, Category: 5)

**Step 8: Implement Error Handling and Notifications**
Your SDK should gracefully handle errors reported by the reader and potentially unsolicited notifications.
*   **Function**: `Handle_Error_Response(parsed_error_frame)`
    *   **Description**: Interprets the `Error Type` and other fields from a parsed error message (MID=0x00). This helps the SDK user understand why a command failed.
    *   **Error Types include**: "Unsupported Protocol Type Number", "Wrong MID", "The instruction cannot be executed in current status", "Incomplete message parameters", "Frame Length Over Limitation", etc..
*   **Asynchronous Handling**: For messages where `Reader notification Flag Bit` (Bit 12) is `1` (e.g., tag data uploading, trigger start/stop messages), your SDK might need a separate thread or an event-driven mechanism to continuously listen for and process these.

By following these steps, you can systematically build a robust SDK that adheres to the "RFID Reader Data Communication Protocol".
